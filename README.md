# Vaterite

Vaterite is a simple Lisp programming language, made to learn about Lisp and also Rust.

Some Vaterite features:
* Pattern matching
* Macros
* Structs
* Lazy Cons

# Getting Started

Vaterite is made 100% in rust without any dependencies. To get it running, a simple `cargo build` will do the job.

Running the file with no arguments will start the REPL or with a `.vtr` file to run as an interpreter. You can try the examples in the `tests` folder.

## What can be done

Some features that would be nice to have in the future:
* Compile to bytecode and run in a VM
* Make syntax objects that store file position metadata
* Suport structs made in native code
* Add FFI suport
